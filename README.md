# My History

I started programming at the pandemic, when my dad told me to learn how to code in Java. Before that I didn't had any coding skill, but I learnt a little but of Java.

At that time, I picked a book from the library that teached you how to make webs. I made a very simple web ak my first month of programming, I didn't made it public and a ransomware infected that computer and now I can't access it. :( (I also forgot the password btw)

Because I didn't know how OSes were made I maked a few (From 2029 to 2024 actually 67 OSes) I made them with HTML. The first one used only images and links. (Well until 2021 I didn't knew that CSS existed xd). And from that I learnt a lot of HTML.

On 2021, my brother decided to also study programming at the Vocational training and in a few months he knew more than me. He told me that there's a website where you can get kinda everything for coding on HTML and Java (W3Schools, yeah, I coded all 2020 with youtube tutorials and that book). And that website stills resolving code issues at 2024.

And since that time, I learnt a lot of Java, a lot of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. And coding looked easy for me. On the summer of 2022 I made one of my latest OSes made with HTML, that one was actually cool (Yeah, also lost it).

On 2022 I discovered W3Spaces, and made my first public web, litech.w3spaces.com (and I deleted it on 2023 because I ran out of webs) and then people of my class, specially one guy who had a yt channel, asked me for making webs for them. And I made them, obviously.

But at November of 2022, the tables rotated for my and my brother. My brother show me a yt channel of a man who made coding tutorials, the god, BroCode.

I started watching him and I learnt JavaFX, C, Python and C++.

And at December 2022, I made Lite Systems 2022.12. The first OSes made with C++. You can see them in [Lite Systems 2022.12 Website](https://lite-systems.webflow.io). The reason why the version 2022.12.17.* has so many sub-versions is because that day I didn't had school :).

So that made me learn a lot of C++.

On Febraury 2024, my mom, my sister and I went to Argentina. There, I made an OS with C++ called CatOS. And that OS was C-O-O-L. That was one of the best OSes I made between 2019 and 2023.

And well on 2023 I made games like MiBox and programs like Lite NT Office. Well it actually was a web but nevermind. Also I made OscorpText for the friend that asked me for the website for his web.

And everthing was kinda interesting at that time, I made Lite Search Motor, Lite Explorer, [LiteMusic](https://surfacesystems.github.io/LiteMusic/) and that things.

But the October 2023, something happened.
At highschool, I liked a girl, and when I told her that I liked her, she said that she was lesbian. Soooooooo, I made [epi](https://elitees.github.io/epi/). One of the coolest things I've ever made with C++. A programmming language. And it was all going good until, I don't know how, but I deleted a folder in which I had all the code of epi and other projects. So, I continued making LaQTeOS. Another OS made with C++. (Fun fact: to the girl that told me that she was lesbian, a friend an I called her LaQTeDije (the one I told you)) That OS had other OSes inside like LeafOS or CaOS. That OS is not public at the moment. I also made RayOS, an OS with Java JFrame that's also cool.

But on May 2024, I decided to start making serious software. I'm actually making AliCode, that is an Lightweight IDE made with Java for coding on Java, C++, epi and Web. I made eExplore, that is a search motor made with Java, I'm actually working on it for generating more URL's. And I'm preparing for making an Office software in Java.

So well, that's all.
