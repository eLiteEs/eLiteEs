## Hi! 
I'm a 13 year old programmer from Spain with 4+ years of experience.

I coded a lot of things since then, but here are my fav ones which I made open-source:
- [epi²](https://github.com/eLiteEs/epi2)
- [dlib](https://github.com/SurfaceSystems/dlib)
- [C^8](https://github.com/eLiteEs/cb8-2)
- [LitePlusPlus](https://github.com/SurfaceSystems/LitePlusPlus)
- [MiBox](https://github.com/SurfaceSystems/MiBox)
- [LiteMusic](https://github.com/SurfaceSystems/LiteMusic)
- [DinoAvión](https://github.com/SurfaceSystems/DinoAvion)

There are also projects that aren't open-source but they're also cool like:
- [epi](https://elitees.github.io/epi/)
- [eCorreo](https://e--correo.web.app/)

## If you want to help me on any project send an email to
elite.atencionalcliente(at)gmail.com
